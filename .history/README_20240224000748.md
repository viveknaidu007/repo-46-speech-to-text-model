# repo-46-speech-to-text-model
here we are building a converting the audio to text



Project Steps : 

    Create Jupyter widgets to record audio and stop recording
    Use pyaudio to record microphone audio
    Create a speech recognition system using vosk
    Add punctuation to the text transcript using recasepunc


To follow this project, please install the following locally:

    Python 3.8+
    Python packages
        vosk pip install vosk
        pydub pip install pydub
        transformers pip install transformers
        torch pip install torch -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
        pyaudio pip install pyaudio
        ipywidgets pip install ipywidgets

#pip install vosk pydub transformers pyaudio ipywidgets torch -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html



Vosk

You'll need to download a model file to run vosk properly. This will automatically download when you run this code:

from vosk import Model
Model(model_name="vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15")


The full vosk model is large (1+ GB). If you want to use it, just specify vosk-model-en-us-0.22 as the model name.

If the models don't automatically download, you can find them here.



Punctuation

By default, vosk will output text with no punctuation. To add in punctuation, we'll need a different model. To get this, follow these steps:

    Download the model here - caution: it's 1 GB+ in size.
    Extract the zip file into the same directory as your code.




Pyaudio

Pyaudio can be a little tricky to install, since it depends on system packages. Check the homepage for specific instructions for each OS.

You'll also want to figure out the right device to record from. Run this code to find the index of your microphone:

# Find audio device index
import pyaudio
p = pyaudio.PyAudio()
for i in range(p.get_device_count()):
    print(p.get_device_info_by_index(i))

p.terminate()
